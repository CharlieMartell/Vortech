This project works, too, but it's more experimental, and could be subject to significant API churn and experimentation. Please choose accordingly.\n\n***\n\n[Redux](redux.js.org) bindings for [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router).\n\n- Keep your router state inside your Redux Store.\n- Interact with the Router with the same API you use to interact with the rest of your app state.\n- Completely interoperable with existing React Router API. `<Link />`, `router.transitionTo()`, etc. still work.\n- Serialize and deserialize router state.\n- Works with time travel feature of Redux Devtools!\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save redux-router@1.0.0-beta7\n```\n\n## Why\n\nReact Router is a fantastic routing library, but one downside is that it abstracts away a very crucial piece of application state — the current route! This abstraction is super useful for route matching and rendering, but the API for interacting with the router to 1) trigger transitions and 2) react to state changes within the component lifecycle leaves something to be desired.\n\nIt turns out we already solved these problems with Flux (and Redux): We use action creators to trigger state changes, and we use higher-order components to subscribe to state changes.\n\nThis library allows you to keep your router state **inside your Redux store**. So getting the current pathname, query, and params is as easy as selecting any other part of your application state.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { combineReducers, applyMiddleware, compose, createStore } from 'redux';\nimport { reduxReactRouter, routerStateReducer, ReduxRouter } from 'redux-router';\nimport { createHistory } from 'history';\nimport { Route } from 'react-router';\n\n// Configure routes like normal\nconst routes = (\n  <Route path=\"/\" component={App}>\n    <Route path=\"parent\" component={Parent}>\n      <Route path=\"child\" component={Child} />\n      <Route path=\"child/:id\" component={Child} />\n    </Route>\n  </Route>\n);\n\n// Configure reducer to store state at state.router\n// You can store it elsewhere by specifying a custom `routerStateSelector`\n// in the store enhancer below\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  router: routerStateReducer,\n  //app: rootReducer, //you can combine all your other reducers under a single namespace like so\n});\n\n// Compose reduxReactRouter with other store enhancers\nconst store = compose(\n  applyMiddleware(m1, m2, m3),\n  reduxReactRouter({\n    routes,\n    createHistory\n  }),\n  devTools()\n)(createStore)(reducer);\n\n\n// Elsewhere, in a component module...\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { pushState } from 'redux-router';\n\nconnect(\n  // Use a selector to subscribe to state\n  state => ({ q: state.router.location.query.q }),\n\n  // Use an action creator for navigation\n  { pushState }\n)(SearchBox);\n```\n\n### Works with Redux Devtools (and other external state changes)\n\nredux-router will notice if the router state in your Redux store changes from an external source other than the router itself — e.g. the Redux Devtools — and trigger a transition accordingly!\n\n## API\n\n### `reduxReactRouter({ routes, createHistory, routerStateSelector })`\n\nA Redux store enhancer that adds router state to the store.\n\n### `routerStateReducer(state, action)`\n\nA reducer that keeps track of Router state.\n\n### `<ReduxRouter>`\n\nA component that renders a React Router app using router state from a Redux store.\n\n### `pushState(state, pathname, query)`\n\nAn action creator for `history.pushState()`. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState)\n\nBasic example (let say we are at `http://example.com/order/new`):\n```js\ndispatch(pushState(null, '/orders/' + order.id.toString(), ''))\n```\nProvided that `order.id` is set and equals `123` it will change browser address bar to `http://example.com/order/123` and appends this URL to the browser history (without reloading the page).\n\n**NOTE:** clicking back button will change address bar back to `http://example.com/order/new` but will **not** change page content\n**NOTE:** `pathname` has to be a string, numbers will generate an exception\n\n### `replaceState(state, pathname, query)`\n\nAn action creator for `history.replaceState()`. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#The_replaceState()_method)\n\nWorks similar to the `pushState` except that it doesn't create new browser history entry.\n\nReferring to the `pushState` example: clicking back button will change address bar back to the URL before `http://example.com/order/new` and will change page content.\n\n## Handling authentication via a higher order component\n\n@joshgeller threw together a good example on how to handle user authentication via a higher order component. Check out [joshgeller/react-redux-jwt-auth-example](https://github.com/joshgeller/react-redux-jwt-auth-example)\n\n## Bonus: Reacting to state changes with redux-rx\n\nThis library pairs well with [redux-rx](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-rx) to trigger route transitions in response to state changes. Here's a simple example of redirecting to a new page after a successful login:\n\n```js\nconst LoginPage = createConnector(props$, state$, dispatch$, () => {\n  const actionCreators$ = bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch$);\n  const pushState$ = actionCreators$.map(ac => ac.pushState);\n\n  // Detect logins\n  const didLogin$ = state$\n    .distinctUntilChanged(state => state.loggedIn)\n    .filter(state => state.loggedIn);\n\n  // Redirect on login!\n  const redirect$ = didLogin$\n    .withLatestFrom(\n      pushState$,\n      // Use query parameter as redirect path\n      (state, pushState) => () => pushState(null, state.router.query.redirect || '/')\n    )\n    .do(go => go());\n\n  return combineLatest(\n    props$, actionCreators$, redirect$,\n    (props, actionCreators) => ({\n      ...props,\n      ...actionCreators\n    });\n});\n```\n\nA more complete example is forthcoming.\n",
